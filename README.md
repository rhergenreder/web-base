Web-Base is a php framework which provides basic web functionalities.

### Current Functionalities:
- Installation Guide with automatic database setup

### Upcoming:
I actually don't know what i want to implement here. There are quite to many CMS out there with alot of vulnerabilities. There also exist some frameworks already. This project is meant to provide a stable project base to implement what ever a developer wants to: Dynamic Homepages, Webshops, ..
